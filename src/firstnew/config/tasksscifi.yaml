    Generate 10 innovative near-future sci-fi story ideas, each exploring a unique scientific or technological concept and its potential impact on society. 
    Ensure that each concept is grounded in current scientific trends or emerging technologies, 
    but pushes the boundaries of what's currently possible. Avoid rehashing common sci-fi tropes; instead, strive for fresh angles on familiar themes or entirely novel concepts. 
    Your ideas should spark curiosity and provoke thought about potential future scenarios. Include a mix of utopian and dystopian elements, showing both the promise and perils 
    of technological advancement. Aim for a tone that's intellectually stimulating yet accessible, avoiding overly technical jargon.
